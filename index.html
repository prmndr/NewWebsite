            <p>
                Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices in software development aimed at improving efficiency, quality, and speed of delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
                CI involves automating the process of integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository frequently, often several times a day. This helps in detecting and fixing integration errors early.
            </p>
            <p>
                CD extends CI by automatically deploying code changes to production or staging environments after passing through various stages of testing, including automated tests and manual reviews.

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                Implementing CI/CD requires a combination of tools, processes, and cultural changes within the development team. Common tools include Jenkins, Travis CI, GitLab CI, and CircleCI for CI, and Kubernetes, Docker, and AWS CodeDeploy for CD.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's essential to have a robust testing strategy in place, including unit tests, integration tests, and automated end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability of the deployment pipeline.
